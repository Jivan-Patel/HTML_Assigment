right now

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.439
And Shadlu continues to raid

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:10.400
He takes Sagar out, number 41 is out

22
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.560

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.000
Shubham will go out

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.520
HS Rakesh succeeds

30
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.600
Gujarat dominating in the first half

31
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.119
Number four out, first half belongs to Gujarat Giants

32
00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:46.479
and to Nitin Pawar

33
00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:49.280

34
00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.520

[Applause]

42
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.250
[Music]

46
00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.360
Bonus also given, quite easily here

47
00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.840
But Shadlu gets his first tackle point

48
00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.840
earned

49
00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.200
Tamil Thalaivas all out, Gujarat’s lead stays

50
00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.040

Three points Gujarat Giants

52
00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.640
And right now we’re at the midpoint of the match friends

53
00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.640
where you’re watching the action via Ref Cam

54
00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.319
coverage

55
00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.400
Raid around, one point Gujarat Giants – Lucky

56
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.319
Sharma. Sharma got a start today in right

57
00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:56.959
corner, and he made another right tackle

58
00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:58.790
Lucky

59
00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.800
[Applause]

60
00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.000
Shadlu’s multi-point raid – brilliant!

61
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.959
Two points Gujarat Giants, number five and

62
00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:07.920
six out

63
00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.599
Can you imagine, Shadlu got

64
00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:11.120
one point in defense and in raiding

65
00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.680
five more – this guy is hungry for points

66
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.280
Pawan Sherawat – a player of huge respect

67
00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.280
in kabaddi. Neel, you know this well.

68
00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.519
When defenders get him out

69
00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:27.840
they gain double confidence

70
00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.920
because they’ve taken out their role model

71
00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.720
Match on – Gujarat Giants

72
00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.680
Congratulations. First win of Season 12

73
00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.959
In War of Stars, Arjun Deshwal did take

74
00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:42.000
Shadlu out twice, but the winning team

75
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.959
is Shadlu’s
